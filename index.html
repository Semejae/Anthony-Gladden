  <h3 class="bold"><em>ABOUT ME:</em></h3>

  <div class="important">
  <p>My name is <strong>Anthony Gladden</strong> I was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. I graduated High School at Catonsville High where I recieved my diploma.
    After school I went off to work in security as an Armed Security Guard/ Private investigator for a few years. I then moved to Seattle, Washington with my two cousins June of 2020.
    Being here for awhile seeing all the oportunities I had here where I didnt back home, I decided to follow the career i truly wanted to be in since 9th grade odf high school. I decidedi was going to be in the software development industy
    because ive always wanted to make my own games and websites. So seeing that was a route I could follow I hopped on as soon as I could.</p>
